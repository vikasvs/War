# War
what is is good for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING


Language: Java

Simple war card game based on standard rules of war. Specific rule for this game is that war is determined by adding the ranks of 2 recent cards and whoever has the highest rank gets both cards. Use ArrayLits to store the cards in the program, along with some standard java imports. Decided to make a seperate card class to hold the card along with some helper functions to stringify card values. In game of war started by checking base cases of simple 1 card is greater than the other, if not then go to war special case. Spending a few more hours could probably iron out any other bugs.

Compile in terminal using javac WarGame.java
Run using java WarGame
